CSS Flexbox Fundamentals

This is a visual demo on how the various properties in CSS Flexbox works, I enjoy learning and teaching others along the way.
I continue adding to this project whenever I learn a new Flexbox property as well. 
This project incorporates responsive design for any browser size, ie mobile or desktop. 

Happy Learning & Coding!
